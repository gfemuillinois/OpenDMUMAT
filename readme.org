#+TITLE: OpenDM CMC Damage model: UMAT implementation
#+AUTHOR: Bryce Mazurowski
#+EMAIL: brycepm2@gmail.com

* Goal
This repository contains a C++ implementation of an Abaqus UMAT
interface to the OpenDM damage model. Both the 2-mode and 4-mode
versions are implemented.

* Theory manuals
A theory manual for the 2-mode model can be found [[/Manuals/OpenDM_TheoryManual.pdf][here]]
* User manuals
** General manual
A manual for use of the OpenDM UMAT is [[/Manuals/UMAT_UserManual.org][here]]
This manual is also still under construction.
** Videos
Videos of compilation and Abaqus testing of the UMAT are available below
*** Windows
Under construction
*** Linux
